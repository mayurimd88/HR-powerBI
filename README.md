HR Data Analysis on Employee Attrition ðŸ“Š

I'm excited to announce the completion of my Power BI dashboard, focused on analyzing employee attrition within our company.

 Objective:
To highlight key metrics and indicators crucial for understanding attrition patterns.

 Key Performance Metrics:
 Total Attrition: 237 employees
 Attrition Rate: 16.1%
 Average Age of Departing Employees: 37 years
 Average Salary of Departing Employees: 6.5K
 Average Tenure of Departing Employees: 7 years

 Insights:
1. Attrition by Job Role:
    The highest number of departures was among lab technicians, with 62 leaving the company.

2. Attrition by Salary:
    Employees earning less than 5K were the most likely to leave.

3. Attrition by Age:
    The age group with the highest attrition rate was 2535 years.

4. Attrition by Tenure:
    The highest number of employees left after just 1 year of service.

 Analysis:
The dashboard reveals significant areas for improvement in employee retention. High attrition rates among lab technicians and lowersalaried employees indicate a need for targeted interventions.

 Recommendations:
1. Targeted Retention Programs:
    Develop initiatives aimed specifically at lab technicians to improve job satisfaction and retention.

2. Salary Reviews:
    Reevaluate the salary structure, especially for those earning below 5K, to ensure competitive compensation.

3. Career Development Plans:
    Implement career development strategies for employees aged 2535 to support longterm growth within the company.

4. Onboarding and Early Tenure Support:
    Enhance onboarding processes and provide substantial support during employees' first year to reduce early departures.
